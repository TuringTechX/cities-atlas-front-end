economic-composition-title = What is { $name-plural } economic composition?

economic-composition-para-1 = { $name } has a population of { $population } people ({ $pop-year }) and an estimated GDP per capita of ${ $gdppc } (2020).  Out of the { $region-city-count } cities covered in { $region-name }, { $name } ranks as the { $region-size-rank } most populated, and displays the { $region-wealth-rank } highest GDP per capita. { $name-plural } labor force consists of about { $num-employ } workers.

economic-composition-para-2 = The largest sector in { $name } consists of { $largest-sector } industries, accounting for { $largest-sector-share-percent }% of { $composition-type } in the city. A prime example is { $largest-3-digit-industry-in-sector }, providing { $largest-3-digit-industry-in-sector-share-percent }% of the city’s employment. Similarly, it shows a large presence in { $second-largest-sector } ({ $second-largest-sector-share-percent }%), in industries such as { $second-largest-3-digit-industry-in-sector } ({ $second-largest-3-digit-industry-in-sector-share-percent }%).

good-at-title = What does { $name } specialize in?

  [global_pop] global peers by similar population
  [global_income] global peers by similar income per capita
  [global_eucdist] global peers by similar economic structure
  [regional_pop] regional peers by similar population
  [regional_income] regional peers by similar income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure
  [region] all regional peers
}. For each industry, it looks at whether the industry accounts for a larger or a smaller share of overall employment in { $name } than in {
  $benchmark-type ->
  *[benchmark_city_name] { $benchmark-type }
  [global_pop] global peers by similar population
  [global_income] global peers by similar income per capita
  [global_eucdist] global peers by similar economic structure
  [regional_pop] regional peers by similar population
  [regional_income] regional peers by similar income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure
  [region] all regional peers
}. If bars run to the right, the industries are, in relative terms, more important employers in { $name } than in {
  $benchmark-type ->
  *[benchmark_city_name] { $benchmark-type }
  [global_pop] global peers by similar population
  [global_income] global peers by similar income per capita
  [global_eucdist] global peers by similar economic structure
  [regional_pop] regional peers by similar population
  [regional_income] regional peers by similar income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure
  [region] all regional peers
}. If bars run to the left, the opposite is true. The length of the bar shows how many times larger or smaller the industry’s employment share is in { $name } than in {

city-similarity-title = What cities are similar to { $name }?
city-similarity-para-1 = We can assess the similarity between the economies of different cities in the world by looking at whether they are competitive in the same industries. This similarity helps select cities that may have similar development opportunities and challenges, or that may give a sense of what industries are feasible in a city like yours.

industry-space-title = What is { $name-plural } position in the industry space?
industry-space-para-1 = The Industry Space showcases the technological relatedness between all industries, shown as dots in this visualization, and groups them into knowledge clusters. Industries that are near each other typically require similar know-how. The size of the dots shows the relative presence in comparison to {
  $benchmark-type ->
  *[benchmark_city_name] { $benchmark-type }
  [global_pop] global peers by similar population
  [global_income] global peers by similar income per capita
  [global_eucdist] global peers by similar economic structure
  [regional_pop] regional peers by similar population
  [regional_income] regional peers by similar income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure
  [region] all regional peers
} of each industry in { $name }. Thereby, we obtain a bird’s eye view of the economic composition of { $name } in terms of the knowledge clusters in which it excels.
industry-space-para-2 = { $name-plural } position in the Industry Space, helps understand which diversification paths may be available to the city, as industries close to those that are already well-developed in { $name } are likely candidates for growth.

growth-opportunities-title = What are the growth opportunities in { $name }?
growth-opportunities-para-1 = Building on all these measures, we can rank industries not only by their relative presence in { $name }, but by their relative technological fit to { $name-plural } productive structure. These measures can help analysts understand how { $name-plural } economic strengths and weakness compare to those of {
  $benchmark-type ->
  *[benchmark_city_name] { $benchmark-type }
  [global_pop] global peers by similar population
  [global_income] global peers by similar income per capita
  [global_eucdist] global peers by similar economic structure
  [regional_pop] regional peers by similar population
  [regional_income] regional peers by similar income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure
  [region] all regional peers
}. Additionally, it can help identify industries that are surprisingly large (or small) in { $name }.
