economic-composition-para-1 = { $name } has a population of { $population } people ({ $pop-year }) and an estimated GDP per capita of ${ $gdppc } (2020).  Out of the { $region-city-count } cities covered in { $region-name }, { $name } ranks as the { $region-size-rank } most populated, and displays the { $region-wealth-rank } highest GDP per capita. { $name-plural } labor force consists of about { $num-employ } workers.

economic-composition-para-2 = The largest sector in { $name } consists of { $largest-sector } industries, accounting for { $largest-sector-share-percent }% of { $composition-type } in the city. A prime example is { $largest-3-digit-industry-in-sector }, providing { $largest-3-digit-industry-in-sector-share-percent }% of the city’s employment. Similarly, it shows a large presence in { $second-largest-sector } ({ $second-largest-sector-share-percent }%), in industries such as { $second-largest-3-digit-industry-in-sector } ({ $second-largest-3-digit-industry-in-sector-share-percent }%).

  [global_eucdist] global peers by similar economic structure
  [regional_pop] regional peers by similar population
  [regional_income] regional peers by similar population and income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure
  [region] all regional peers
}. For each industry, it looks at whether the industry accounts for a larger or a smaller share of overall employment in { $name } than in {

  *[benchmark_city_name] { $benchmark-type }
  [global_pop] global peers by similar population
  [global_income] global peers by similar population and income per capita
  [global_eucdist] global peers by similar economic structure
  [regional_pop] regional peers by similar population
  [regional_income] regional peers by similar population and income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure
  [region] all regional peers
}. If bars run to the right, the industries are, in relative terms, more important employers in { $name } than in {

  [global_pop] global peers by similar population
  [global_income] global peers by similar population and income per capita

  [regional_pop] regional peers by similar population
  [regional_income] regional peers by similar population and income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure

}. If bars run to the left, the opposite is true. The length of the bar shows how many times larger or smaller the industry’s employment share is in { $name } than in {

city-similarity-title = What cities are similar to { $name }?
city-similarity-para-1 = We can assess the similarity between the economies of different cities in the world by looking at whether they are competitive in the same industries. This similarity helps select cities that may have similar development opportunities and challenges, or that may give a sense of what industries are feasible in a city like yours.

industry-space-title = What is { $name-plural } position in the industry space?
industry-space-para-1 = The Industry Space showcases the technological relatedness between all industries, shown as dots in this visualization, and groups them into knowledge clusters. Industries that are near each other typically require similar know-how. The size of the dots shows the relative presence in comparison to {
  $benchmark-type ->
  *[benchmark_city_name] { $benchmark-type }
  [global_pop] global peers by similar population
  [global_income] global peers by similar population and income per capita
  [global_eucdist] global peers by similar economic structure

  [regional_income] regional peers by similar population and income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure

} of each industry in { $name }. Thereby, we obtain a bird’s eye view of the economic composition of { $name } in terms of the knowledge clusters in which it excels.
industry-space-para-2 = { $name-plural } position in the Industry Space, helps understand which diversification paths may be available to the city, as industries close to those that are already well-developed in { $name } are likely candidates for growth.

growth-opportunities-title = What are the growth opportunities in { $name }?
growth-opportunities-para-1 = Building on all these measures, we can rank industries not only by their relative presence in { $name }, but by their relative technological fit to { $name-plural } productive structure. These measures can help analysts understand how { $name-plural } economic strengths and weakness compare to those of {
  $benchmark-type ->
  *[benchmark_city_name] { $benchmark-type }
  [global_pop] global peers by similar population
  [global_income] global peers by similar population and income per capita
  [global_eucdist] global peers by similar economic structure
  [regional_pop] regional peers by similar population
  [regional_income] regional peers by similar population and income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure
  [region] all regional peers
}. Additionally, it can help identify industries that are surprisingly large (or small) in { $name }.

about-what-is-html =
  <p>
      Metroverse is an urban economy navigator built at the <a target="_blank" href="https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/">Growth Lab</a> at Harvard University.  It is based on over a decade of research on how economies grow and diversify and offers a detailed look into the specialization patterns of cities. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As a dynamic resource, the tool is continually evolving with new data and features to help answer questions such as: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>What is the economic composition of my city?</em></li>
    <li><em>How does my city compare to cities around the globe?</em></li>
    <li><em>Which cities look most like mine?</em></li>
    <li><em>What are the technological capabilities that underpin my city&rsquo;s current economy?</em></li>
    <li><em>Which growth and diversification paths does that suggest for the future?</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>As city leaders, job seekers, investors and researchers grapple with 21st century urbanization challenges, the answer to these questions are fundamental to understanding the potential of a city.</p>
  <p>
    Metroverse delivers new insights on these questions by placing a city&rsquo;s technological capabilities and knowhow at the heart of its growth prospects, where the range and nature of existing capabilities strongly influences how future diversification unfolds. Metroverse makes visible what a city is good at today to help understand what it can become tomorrow.

  <p>
    To build the Metroverse prototype, the Growth Lab worked in coordination with <a target="_blank" href="https://citypossible.com/">Mastercard City Possible</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cityleadership.harvard.edu/">Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iadb.org/en">Inter-American Development Bank</a> to convene a 15-person Pilot User Group composed of city leaders across the world. By engaging with this group throughout the development process, we were able to gather valuable insights that influenced how we designed the tool, helping to ensure that it is useful for a diverse set of urban planners, policymakers and data analysts.

    The methodologies behind Metroverse were developed over the course of the past decade and build on the methodologies in the Growth Lab&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" href="https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/">Atlas of Economic Complexity</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In future versions of Metroverse, we are planning to give a detailed description of these methodologies. For now, if you are interested in some of the research that inspired Metroverse, you can have a look at the following publications:

    Hidalgo, C.A., Klinger, B., Barab&aacute;si, A.L. and Hausmann, R., 2007. The product space conditions the development of nations. <em>Science, 317</em>(5837), pp.482-487.
  </cite>
  <p>
    This paper introduces the notion of a Product Space - a concept that is analogous to Metroverse&rsquo;s Industry Space -  and how it can be used to predict how national economies diversify.
  </p>

  </cite>
  <p>
    This paper introduces the Industry Space. Apart from some minor details in implementation, it shows how we can construct industry spaces from information on how firms combine different economic activities in one and the same establishment.

  </cite>
  <p>
    This paper shows how industry spaces can help understand transformative change in local economies.

  </cite>
  <p>
    This paper explores the notion of an industry space in greater detail.

    Neffke, F. and Henning, M., 2013. Skill relatedness and firm diversification. <em>Strategic Management Journal, 34</em>(3), pp.297-316.
  </cite>
  <p>
    This paper discusses the notion of industrial relatedness and the different ways in which it can be measured.
